## Features

- **Zero Config**: Defaults with JetBrains Mono, macOS font rendering, and low-res font sizing.
- **Theme-Aware Experience**: Auto-switches between dark and light modes with macOS, with tuned selection colors, font weight, and practical color overrides support.
- **Curated Shell Suite**: Built-in zsh plugins with optional CLI tools for prompt, diff, and navigation workflows.
- **Fast & Lightweight**: 40% smaller binary, instant startup, lazy loading, stripped-down GPU-accelerated core.
- **WezTerm-Compatible Config**: Use WezTerm's Lua config directly with full API compatibility and no migration.
- **Polished Defaults**: Copy on select, clickable file paths, history peek from full-screen apps, pane input broadcast, and visual bell on background tab completion.

## Quick Start

1. [Download Kaku DMG](https://github.com/tw93/Kaku/releases/latest) & Drag to Applications
2. Or install with Homebrew: `brew install tw93/tap/kakuku`
3. Open Kaku. The app is notarized by Apple, so it opens without security warnings
4. On first launch, Kaku will automatically set up your shell environment

## Kaku AI

Kaku includes a built-in assistant with two modes, plus a single settings page for AI coding tools.

- **Error recovery**: When a command fails, Kaku automatically suggests a fix. Press `Cmd + Shift + E` to apply.
- **Natural language to command**: Type `# <description>` at the prompt and press Enter. Kaku sends the query to the LLM and injects the resulting command back into the prompt, ready to review and run.
- **AI Tools Config**: Manage settings for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, Kimi Code, and more.

### Provider Presets

Kaku Assistant supports built-in provider presets for quick setup. Select a provider from the dropdown in `kaku ai` to auto-fill the API base URL and available models:

| Provider | Base URL | Models |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| OpenAI | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | (free text) |
| Custom | (manual) | (manual) |

When Kaku Assistant has a suggestion ready after a command error, press `Cmd + Shift + E` to apply it.

## Why Kaku?

I heavily rely on the CLI for both work and personal projects. Tools I've built, like [Mole](https://github.com/tw93/mole) and [Pake](https://github.com/tw93/pake), reflect this.

I used Alacritty for years and learned to value speed and simplicity. As my workflow shifted toward AI-assisted coding, I wanted stronger tab and pane ergonomics. I also explored Kitty, Ghostty, Warp, and iTerm2. Each is strong in different areas, but I still wanted a setup that matched my own balance of performance, defaults, and control.

WezTerm is robust and highly hackable, and I am grateful for its engine and ecosystem. Kaku builds on that foundation with practical defaults for day one use, while keeping full Lua-based customization and a fast, lightweight feel.

So I built Kaku to be that environment: fast, polished, and ready to work.

### Performance

| Metric | Upstream | Kaku | Methodology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Executable Size** | ~67 MB | ~40 MB | Aggressive symbol stripping & feature pruning |
| **Resources Volume** | ~100 MB | ~80 MB | Asset optimization & lazy-loaded assets |
| **Launch Latency** | Standard | Instant | Just-in-time initialization |
| **Shell Bootstrap** | ~200ms | ~100ms | Optimized environment provisioning |

Achieved through aggressive stripping of unused features, lazy loading of color schemes, and shell optimizations.

## FAQ

**Is there a Windows or Linux version?** Not currently. Kaku is macOS-only for now.

**Can I use transparent windows?** Yes — set `config.window_background_opacity` in `~/.config/kaku/kaku.lua`.

**The `kaku` command is missing.** Run `/Applications/Kaku.app/Contents/MacOS/kaku init --update-only && exec zsh -l`, then `kaku doctor`.
